# Final Assignment
Create a Flask application like the one we just built, and integrate the Yelp api into. When a user gives you an address, show them the top 3 recommendations according to the Yelp API and show them the results on the index page.

If you wanted to, you could optionally add it search terms.

Part of the assignment will be to get your application up on Github and Heroku.

When your project is ready, submit it to me using the Submit Assignment tab above. Zip the project and attach that zip as a file. In the assignment comments, paste in your Heroku URL and the Github URL.
